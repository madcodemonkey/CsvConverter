# Reading CSV files: Converters 

There are two types of converters, built-in/default and custom type converters.  The built-in/default converters, which convert strings into privitive types by default, and custom converters, which are created by you to convert strings into other types.   All built/default converters are held within the CsvToClassService class Converter property, which helps it convert a string into an object to assign to a class property.
