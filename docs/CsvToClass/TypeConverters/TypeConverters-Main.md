# Reading CSV files: Converters 

Convert strings into C# types.  The string can come directly from the CSV file OR it could have passed through one or more  [ pre-converters](../PreConverters/PreConverters-Main.md).  There are two types of converters, default and custom type converters.  The default converters, which convert strings into types, and custom converters, which are created by you to convert strings into other types.
