# Upgrading from V1 to V2

- Reader and writer services changes
	- Services have been renamed
		- Replace ClassToCsvService with CsvWriterService
		- Replace CsvToClassService with CsvReaderService
	- Services are now both in the CsvConverter namespace
		- Delete all references to the CsvConverter.CsvToClass namespace 
		- Delete all references to the CsvConverter.ClassToCsv namespace 
	- The writer services writing method was renamed from WriterRecord to WriteRecord so that it is truly the opposite of GetRecord, which is used when reading. Sadly this typo has been in the code for a while.
- Configuration settings changes
    - Configuration.IgnoreBlankRows property on the reader or writer service was renamed to BlankRowsAreReturnedAsNull because that's what it was really doing in V1.
- pre-converters changes
	- See "How do I create a custom converter?" instructions: 
	  https://github.com/madcodemonkey/CsvConverter/blob/master/docs/Converters/Converters-Main.md
		- Don't forget to set IsPreConverter = true in the attribute; otherwise, it will become the converter instead.
	- Any string converter can now be used as a pre-converter

		- TextReplacerCsvToClassPreConverter can be replaced with either of these:
			- CsvConverterStringReplaceTextEveryMatch

		- TrimCsvToClassPreConverter is replaced with CsvConverterStringTrimmer.
		- StringIsNullOrWhiteSpaceSetToNullCsvToClassPreConverter is replaced with CsvConverterStringReplaceNullOrWhiteSpaceWithNewValue
	- ICsvToClassPreConverter deleted.  Converters should inherit from one of the following
		- CsvConverterTypeBase
