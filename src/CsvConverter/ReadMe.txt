Welcome to Version 2!!!

This is a major new release and a rewrite of many of the features from version 1.  
Hopefully, you find that it is a simplified model compared to V1.  This is also 
the first relase of the .NET Standard version, which can be used with 
.NET Core or the .NET Framework.

I've created an upgrade document on my GitHub site:

Please follow the instructions if you need to upgrade from Version 1 to Version 2.
